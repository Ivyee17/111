excerpt: 'In the system design process, it is an important issue to consider the order of class development. Different orders of class development may have great impact on the cost, efficiency and fault tolerance of the project. Because of that, it is an essential issue to consider which class should be developed before the others. In this paper, we present an approach to recommend a reasonable development order of classes with minimum development cost based on design class diagram and genetic algorithm. It helps the designer to improve their development strategy and to prevent mistakes resulted from improper development order of classes. We also provide a phase tree to help developers visualize and analyze the details of each development phase. At last, we implement a tool and illustrate that the proposed approach is sound and effective with two case studies.'
