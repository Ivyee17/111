This personal website has migrated to the new site: https://whwu17.github.io/

This repo is a redirect repo to the new site and a historical backup with past revisions.

All links from https://ivyee17.github.io/ should be redirected to the new site.

## Develop

This GitHub page was built with [Jekyll 3.9.2](http://jekyllrb.com/), and should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~
